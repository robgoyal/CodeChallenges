## Programming Challenges

#### Purpose

This repository is to post solutions to programming challenges from popular websites such as HackerRank, LeetCode, TopCoder, and Cracking The Coding Interview. 

As of right now,  only HackerRank and CTCI challenges will be included. 

#### Motivation

From what I've seen from personal experiences and what I've heard, programming challenges are the key way for recruiters to analyze your technical skills in interviews. This repo is my main reason for this along with improving problem solving and critical thinking skills.
